## Setup
- get ubuntu
    - if using windows, download ubuntu (linux subsystem)
    - can choose to download a VM, run ubuntu desktop, or just get the subsystem; subsystem is recommended because it is lighter, but I plan to run ubuntu desktop very soon
    - if using mac, switch from zsh to bash through `chsh -s /bin/bash`
- force update: `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo reboot`
    - this is your system so you will have sudo perms
- download VS code - IDE of choice
- connect subsystem to VS code
- download packages
    - test installation: `tree` 
- version of python
- CLIs - AWS, Slack, etc
    - Slack CLI: https://api.slack.com/automation/quickstart
    - AWS CLI: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html; non-technical people can use AWS Management Console but I would like to get everyone comfortable with terminal commands as much as possible
- clone repo
- create a feature branch before making any changes
